## ReelAndMeal
A project to implement 2 separate APIs to create an app to find restaurants and movies

# Description
A user-friendly website that helps you find great restaurants by city and discover top-rated movies by genre.

# User story
We're developing this app with the aim of helping people who find themselves unsure about where to dine when they're out with friends. 
Our added feature enhances the experience by suggesting a movie to enjoy while having a meal or simply when in the mood for a good film.
This page offers two distinct services: one for discovering top-rated food options and another for finding highly-rated films. 
These services can be used independently or in combination.
Consider this scenario: you're hungry but uncertain about where to eat, and you're also craving some entertainment but can't decide what to watch. 
That's where our website becomes your go to solution.
These features are flexible, allowing you to use them separately or together. 
If you're primarily interested in dining out, focus on the restaurant section. 
If you're looking for a great movie night at home, explore the movie section.
